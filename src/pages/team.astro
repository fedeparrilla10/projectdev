                  Regina Jarque is an award-winning designer known for her
                  creative and innovative approach to design. As Principal at
                  Jarque Studio, she skillfully leads a wide range of projects
                  that blend luxury and functionality, embracing the
                  multidimensional nature of life and culture. With a notable
                  portfolio including national and international projects,
                  Jarque’s journey reflects a commitment to transcend
                  conventional definitions and establish new standards in
                  design. At the core of Regina Jarque’s design philosophy is
                  the profound belief that spaces are not mere structures, but
                  rather, vessels waiting to unfold unique experiences. An
                  architect of emotions, she forges connections between spaces
                  and souls, curating environments that invite exploration and
                  introspection.<br /><br />
                  With a professional journey spanning over a decade, her designs
                  are present in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Dubai, Mexico
                  City, Los Angeles, Miami, and Tulum. Her holistic expertise comes
                  to life as she masterfully coordinates and executes complex comprehensive
                  architectural projects, from large-scale hospitality resorts, commercial
                  and retail spaces, to custom residences for private clients, which
                  embody her commitment to translating personal visions into intimate
                  architectural settings. As Principal at Jarque Studio, she leads
                  with a dynamic and hands-on approach, guiding projects from their
                  conception to their realization, harmonizing intricate details
                  with a cohesive vision.<br /><br />
                  Jarque holds a degree in Architecture from Universidad Anáhuac
                  in Mexico City, complemented by a Master of Arts degree in Interior
                  and Spatial Design from the distinguished University of the Arts
                  London (Chelsea College of Arts). Her professional journey includes
                  a tenure as Junior Manager at Sordo Madaleno Arquitectos, followed
                  by her position as Project and Design Manager at Estudio 240. This
                  fusion of formal education and artistic exploration equips her
                  with a unique understanding of design principles and creative dynamics.
                  With a collection of features and recognition from esteemed publications,
                  Jarque’s ever-evolving, multi-faceted style of sophisticated warmth
                  and provocative allure stands as a testament to creative excellence.
                  Regina Jarque’s creations transcend mere spaces; they are vibrant
                  stories yearning to be explored.
